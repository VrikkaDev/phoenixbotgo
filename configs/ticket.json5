We'll respond shortly! Reminders: server is 1.20.4 w/ Expiremental Features running Carpet Mod and hosted in Frankfurt, Germany. PLEASE... You don't need to DM <> or anyone with <> role about server questions. Anyone will be more than happy to answer your questions in #phoenix-general, not just him. Lastly, upon acceptance, you'll be given a trial member role, unlike other servers, we'll remove your trial member status as soon as you say, 'this is a server for me, I wanna stay and help.'",
